    "help": "🤖 **LinuxBot Help**\n\nLinuxBot is an AI chatbot Discord app for remote **Linux administration**.\n\n**🚀 How to Use**\n> Mention the bot (`@LinuxBot`) *or* reply to one of its messages. The AI will read your natural-language request and decide whether to inspect files, modify them, or run commands.\n\n**🔐 Access Control**\nOnly members or roles whose IDs are listed in the `ALLOW_IDS` entry of the bot's `.env` file may issue requests. Unauthorized users are ignored.\n\n**🧰 Core Tools (chosen automatically by the AI):**\n- 📖 **Read** – list directories, view / tail files, check logs & service status.\n- ✏️ **Write** – create / edit / delete files, update configs, manage scripts & cron.\n- 🛠️ **Execute** – run shell commands or scripts, manage services & processes.\n\n**⚠️ Important Safety Note**\nThe bot runs as **root**. Be precise and cautious—avoid casually asking for destructive actions (e.g. wiping data, mass permission changes). For risky tasks, clearly confirm intent.\n\n**✅ Tips**\n- Ask clearly: *“Check disk space and summarize any partitions over 80%.”*\n- Combine steps: *“Create a script at /usr/local/bin/backup.sh then make it executable.”*\n- Let the AI decide tooling—avoid pasting raw shell pipelines unless necessary.\n\n**📎 Links**\nGitHub: https://github.com/purinton/linuxbot\nCommunity {#} Purinton DevOps Discord: https://discord.gg/QSBxQnX7PF\n\nNeed more detail? Just ask for \"more help\" or \"examples\". 🐧"
